## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming Prompts

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered this quarter was Data Quality Management in AI, focusing on enhancing the fairness and accuracy of algorithmic decisions.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to investigate how data augmentation techniques could help reduce biases in existing datasets for predictive modeling, specifically in healthcare.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would incorporate active learning strategies to iteratively improve data quality, instead of relying solely on pre-existing quality metrics.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am interested in exploring Generative AI models like GPT for data imputation and enrichment in scenarios with sparse or incomplete data.
